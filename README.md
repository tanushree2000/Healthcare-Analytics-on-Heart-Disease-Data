# Healthcare-Analytics-on-Heart-Disease-Data

Problem Statement:

Health is real wealth in the pandemic time we all realized the brute effects of covid-19 on
all irrespective of any status. You are required to analyze this health and medical data for
better future preparation.

Description:

This database contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a
subset of 14 of them. In particular, the Cleveland database is the only one that has been
used by ML researchers to this date. The “goal” field refers to the presence of heart
disease in the patient. It is integer valued from 0 (no presence) to 4. Attribute
Information:> 1. age> 2. sex> 3. chest pain type (4 values)> 4. resting blood pressure>
5. serum cholesterol in mg/dl> 6. fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl> 7. resting
electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)> 8. maximum heart rate achieved> 9.
exercise induced angina> 10. oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to
rest> 11. the slope of the peak exercise ST segment> 12. number of major vessels (0-3)
colored by flourosopy> 13. thal: 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversible defect
Find key metrics and factors and show the meaningful relationships between attributes.
Do your own research and come up with your findings
